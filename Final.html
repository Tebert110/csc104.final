        <!-- Why i have the page -->
        <p>
            I got into model building to help relieve stress and to pass the time. As a kid, I had a hard time focusing on anything. My dad interdicted models to me at the age of 6. Ever since then, I have been putting models together whenever I can. I had helped with the stress when I was deployed to Iraq. Iâ€™m here to help guide you through the steps of model building. Yes, the instruction sheet does help, but that is just the basics. I will show you some tricks I have picked up through my time building models and some of the headaches.
